Biostatistician with over 12 yearsâ€™ experience in clinical development, I have developed my skills within an international environment in mid- and big pharmaceutical companies in France and the USA.

Currently working as Biostatistics Team Leader for a big-pharma company in the USA, I provide statistical expertise and support in the development of new drugs in Oncology.

As a **Biostatistics Team Leader**, I provide leadership, guidance, and strategic input as team manager and lead statisticians on project teams who are accountable for all statistical aspects of projects. I am responsible for project staffing and resource planning within Biostatistics & Programming project team and foster team development and ensure satisfactory performance and project delivery. I also take part in the evaluation of potential partnership projects (licensing-in), act as biostat representative in the Protocol Review Committee (PRC) for oncology development and lead the implementation of modern and innovative clinical trial designs and methods (RShiny application).

As a **Statistical Expert**, I participate in international working groups focused on clinical trial simulations and optimizations in the context of innovative designs and methods. My main topics of interest include innovative trial designs in oncology and quantitative decision-making.

What am I really passionate about? To provide statistical expertise for innovative clinical development plan and trial designs. Increasing drug development costs and failure rates require a more efficient drug development program with innovative designs and advanced analysis strategies, coupled together with more rigorous quantitative assessment of their ability to reliably answer key development questions.

I am eager and willing to expand my skills and try out new challenges that may come in my way in USA.
