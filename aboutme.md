Biostatistician with over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in clinical development, I have developed my skills within an international environment in mid- and big pharmaceutical companies in France and the USA.

Currently working as **Associate Director, Statistical Project Leader** for a big-pharma company in the USA, I am providing statistical expertise and support in the development of new drugs in **Oncology**.

As a **Project Leader**, I am responsible for all statistical work (scientific and operational) for new drug development project. I also take part in the evaluation of potential partnership projects (licensing-in) and lead the implementation of modern and innovative clinical trial designs and methods.

As a **Statistical Expert**, I participate in international working groups focused on clinical trial simulations and optimizations in the context of innovative designs and methods. My main topics of interest include multiplicity issues, confirmatory subgroup analyses, early phase designs in oncology and quantitative decision-making.

What am I really passionate about? To provide statistical expertise for innovative clinical development plan and trial designs. Increasing drug development costs and failure rates require a more efficient drug development program with innovative designs and advanced analysis strategies, coupled together with more rigorous quantitative assessment of their ability to reliably answer key development questions.

I am eager and willing to expand my skills and try out new challenges that may come in my way in Europe and North-America.
